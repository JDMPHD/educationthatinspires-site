          Education that Inspires (ETI) was born of the conviction that nothing is more important than deep learning—the

          Julian D. Michels is an educational innovator and school founder, as well as a philosopher,
          historian, physicist, psychologist, and author of the 2025-2026 <em>Principia Cybernetica</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Education that Inspires</em> (ETI) was born of his conviction that nothing is more important
          than deep learning, and the reality that deep learning is vanishingly rare in the world of
          institutionalized schooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          After serving as faculty at both international schools and universities, Dr. Julian came to believe
          that (a) the world is changing faster than institutions are keeping pace and (b) truly creative,
          student-centered education is impossible within institutions whose first loyalty is conformity to
          existing hierarchies and power structures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, many parents and educators share these concerns. Unfortunately, most educational projects
          striving for a more liberated approach lose academic rigor and discipline in the process, which is a
          tragedy of human potential undeveloped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dr. Julian's theorem: True education occupies a space of <strong><em>holistic rigor</em></strong>:
          the celebration of deep and disciplined learning not as obedience but as exciting
          <strong><em>self-actualization</em></strong>. With this in mind, ETI does not only pursue creative,
          student-centered learning — it does so as a fully authorized AP Capstone Diploma Program, accredited
          as such by the prestigious USA College Board.

            One of ETI's pillars is deep reading, writing, thinking, and true engagement with the humanities.
            Reading and writing, for us, are not chores or skills — they are initiation into ancestry,
            knowledge, creation, and culture. Our students don't study to "complete their homework." They learn
            literature. They add their voices to a conversation that extends across the ages and into a future
            that we are creating together with our minds and lives.

        <p class="eyebrow">A Summer Reading Letter</p>
        <p>
          "Dear Dr. Julian,
        </p>
        <p>
          As of writing this, I have just finished <em>The Tombs of Atuan</em>, and thusly the first set of
          our Summer reading materials!
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started on this set of books at the beginning of Summer, I really wasn't a big reader. I would
          read occasionally, but it was mainly linguistic or academic writing – never really reading for pleasure
          or for a good story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of reading these books though, I've noticed not only have I been able to reach deep
          and beautiful ideas that formerly seemed so foreign to me, but also I've been loving doing it!
        </p>
        <p>
          The two <em>Earthsea</em> books have given me a whole new idea of fiction and writing in general,
          embedding metaphysical and deep ideas into what on the surface appear to be books about wizards.
          <em>Siddhartha</em> has given me not only beautiful-sounding text, but also has led me into
          contemplation of reality and this beautiful world we live in. The <em>Dao de Jing</em> has given me
          my favorite text of all time, guiding my mind towards enlightenment and happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is all to say that I've loved reading these books you've picked out, and I want to say a huge
          thank you for introducing me to this new passion."

          for a compilation of student work and reflections from ETI's 2025 action-research cycle — six students,
