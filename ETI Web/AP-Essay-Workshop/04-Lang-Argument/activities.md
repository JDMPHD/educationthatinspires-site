# Rung 4: The Argument Essay — You Are the Source

---

## Bridge-In

In Rung 3, you built arguments from provided sources — someone handed you the evidence. Now the training wheels come off.

In the AP Lang Argument essay, **YOU are the source.** Your reading. Your observations. Your knowledge of history, science, literature, current events. That is your evidence arsenal.

The analytical skills you have been building? Same game, higher stakes. You already know how to construct a thesis, build a line of reasoning, and write commentary that does real analytical work. The difference now is that nobody is handing you a packet of sources. You have to pull evidence from everything you know and deploy it strategically.

**What you can already do (Rungs 1--3):**
- Analyze sources and evaluate evidence
- Identify and explain rhetorical choices
- Construct a thesis and sustain a line of reasoning
- Write evidence-driven body paragraphs with commentary

**What this rung adds:**
- Generating your own evidence from reading, experience, and observation
- Crafting a defensible (not obvious) thesis
- Writing commentary that explains *how* and *why* evidence supports your claim
- Engaging with complexity: counterarguments, qualifications, nuance

**Scoring framework:** Thesis (0--1) + Evidence/Commentary (0--4) + Sophistication (0--1) = **6 points**

## Activity 1 — The Evidence Inventory

### The Prompt

Read the following quotation:

> "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."
> — attributed to Henry Ford

**Write an essay arguing for or against the idea that failure is necessary for meaningful success.**

### Step 1: Brainstorm (5 minutes)

Before you worry about a thesis or an outline, dump everything you know. Your goal: **at least 8--10 potential evidence pieces** in five minutes. Cast the widest net you can.

Use these categories to jog your thinking:

| Category | Think about... |
|----------|---------------|
| **Personal experience** | A time you or someone you know failed and learned (or didn't) |
| **History** | Historical figures, events, or movements shaped by failure |
| **Literature / film** | Characters who failed — and what happened next |
| **Science / technology** | Experiments, inventions, or discoveries that came from failure |
| **Current events** | Recent stories where failure played a role |
| **Sports / arts** | Athletes, musicians, artists who failed publicly |
| **Philosophy / psychology** | Ideas about growth mindset, resilience, or the purpose of struggle |
| **Counterexamples** | Cases where failure was just... failure. No silver lining. |

Write fast. Do not judge your ideas yet — just generate.

### Step 2: Rank Your Evidence (5 minutes)

Now look at your list critically. For each piece of evidence, rate it on two scales:

- **Specificity** (1--5): How concrete and detailed is this? "People fail sometimes" = 1. "Thomas Edison tested over 1,000 filament materials before finding one that worked" = 5.
- **Relevance** (1--5): How directly does this connect to the prompt's claim about failure and success? A tangential anecdote = 1. A case that directly proves or complicates the claim = 5.

**Star your top 3--4 pieces.** These are your essay evidence.

### Step 3: Share and Steal (3 minutes)

Turn to a partner. Share your top-ranked evidence and hear theirs. If they have something better than what is on your list, write it down. Good writers are good thieves.

### Debrief Questions

- What categories did most of your strong evidence come from?
- Did anyone find that their best evidence was a *counterexample* — a case that complicates the prompt rather than simply agreeing with it?
- What is the difference between evidence that *illustrates* a point and evidence that *proves* a point?

## Activity 2 — The Defensible Thesis Lab

The Argument essay thesis is worth 1 point, but it shapes everything else. A weak thesis makes the whole essay harder to write. A strong thesis gives you a roadmap.

### Step 1: Rank These Thesis Statements

Below are five thesis statements responding to the failure prompt. **Rank them from weakest (1) to strongest (5)** and write a one-sentence explanation for each ranking.

> **A.** Failure is bad because it makes people feel discouraged and can ruin their confidence.
>
> **B.** Failure is necessary for meaningful success because it teaches people important lessons.
>
> **C.** While failure can sometimes lead to growth, the idea that it is *necessary* for success oversimplifies the relationship between struggle and achievement — and risks romanticizing hardship that is, for many people, simply destructive.
>
> **D.** There are many examples throughout history of people who failed before succeeding.
>
> **E.** Failure is most valuable not when it "builds character" in some abstract sense, but when it forces a specific recalibration — a concrete change in method, strategy, or understanding that would not have occurred otherwise.

### The Criteria

Use these three questions to evaluate any thesis:

1. **Is it debatable?** Could a reasonable person argue the opposite? If everyone would agree, it is not a thesis — it is an observation.
2. **Does it take a clear position?** The reader should know exactly where you stand after one sentence.
3. **Is it specific enough to guide an essay?** A thesis that could apply to any topic is too vague. A strong thesis tells you what your body paragraphs need to do.

### Ranking Guide (discuss after students rank)

| Thesis | Issue | Score |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **D** | Not a thesis at all — it is a statement of fact. Not debatable. Does not take a position. | Weakest |
| **A** | Takes a position, but it is surface-level and obvious. "Bad because it feels bad" does not give you anywhere interesting to go. | Weak |
| **B** | Defensible and clear, but generic. "Teaches important lessons" is vague — *which* lessons? This is a passable thesis but will not earn sophistication. | Middle |
| **E** | Specific, debatable, and gives the essay a clear direction. Distinguishes between abstract and concrete value of failure. Sets up body paragraphs that can explore *specific recalibration*. | Strong |
| **C** | Debatable, nuanced, and actively engages with the complexity of the prompt. Qualifies the claim ("while... sometimes") and names the stakes ("risks romanticizing hardship"). Sets up a sophisticated argument. | Strongest |

### Step 2: Write Your Own (5 minutes)

Write **three** different thesis statements for the failure prompt. Push yourself — make each one take a slightly different angle or level of specificity.

1. Your safe option (clear and defensible, if a bit straightforward)
2. Your ambitious option (nuanced, specific, maybe a little risky)
3. Your wildcard (the take you are not sure about but find interesting)

### Step 3: Peer Evaluation (5 minutes)

Trade with a partner. For each of their three thesis statements, answer the three criteria questions (debatable? clear position? specific enough?) and **circle the one you think is strongest.** Write one sentence explaining your choice.

## Activity 3 — Commentary Deep Dive

Evidence gets you *some* points. Commentary is where the real scoring happens. The difference between a 2 and a 4 in the Evidence/Commentary row is almost entirely about what you *do* with your evidence after you present it.

### Step 1: Spot the Difference

Below are two versions of the same body paragraph. Both use the same evidence. Read them carefully.

---

**Version 1 (Weak Commentary):**

> Failure is necessary for success because it teaches valuable lessons. For example, Thomas Edison tried thousands of different materials before finding the right filament for the light bulb. He failed many times but kept going. Eventually, he succeeded and invented one of the most important technologies in history. This shows that failure can lead to success.

**Version 2 (Strong Commentary):**

> Failure functions as a necessary mechanism of elimination — not because struggle inherently "builds character," but because each failed attempt narrows the field of possibilities and sharpens the inventor's understanding of the problem. Edison's testing of over a thousand filament materials was not random perseverance; it was systematic exclusion. Each failed material provided specific data about conductivity, durability, and heat resistance that no amount of theoretical planning could replicate. The meaningful success — a commercially viable light bulb — was not achieved *despite* the failures but *through the specific knowledge each failure generated.* This distinction matters: the value of failure lies not in the suffering it causes but in the information it produces.

---

**Identify the differences.** In your notebook, answer:

1. How many sentences in Version 1 are *commentary* (explaining why/how the evidence matters) versus *summary* (restating what happened)?
2. What does Version 2 do *after* presenting the Edison example that Version 1 does not?
3. Find the sentence in Version 2 that most clearly connects the evidence to the larger argument. What makes it effective?

### Step 2: The Commentary Toolkit

Strong commentary answers one or more of these questions:

| Question | What it does |
|----------|-------------|
| **WHY does this evidence matter?** | Explains the significance — moves beyond "this shows that..." |
| **HOW does this evidence support the thesis?** | Draws a specific, logical connection between the example and your claim |
| **WHAT does this reveal about the larger issue?** | Zooms out to connect the specific example to a broader truth or pattern |
| **SO WHAT?** | States the implication — what should the reader take away from this evidence? |

**Sentence patterns to get you started** (use these as scaffolding, then adapt to your own voice):

- "This matters because..."
- "What this reveals is not simply [surface reading] but rather [deeper insight]..."
- "The significance lies not in [obvious takeaway] but in [more nuanced point]..."
- "This example demonstrates that [specific mechanism/process], which suggests..."
- "If [evidence] is true, then [implication for the larger argument]..."
- "This distinction is important because..."

### Step 3: Practice (10 minutes)

Choose **two** of your strongest evidence pieces from Activity 1. For each one:

1. Write 1--2 sentences presenting the evidence (be specific and concrete)
2. Write 2--3 sentences of commentary using the toolkit above

**The rule:** Your commentary must be *at least* as long as your evidence. If you are writing more evidence than commentary, you are summarizing, not analyzing.

## Activity 4 — The Sophistication Challenge

The Sophistication point is the hardest to earn. Only about 5--15% of students get it on any given exam. But it is not magic — it is a set of specific intellectual moves you can practice.

### What Sophistication Actually Looks Like

Sophistication is **not**:
- Using big words
- Writing longer essays
- Having more evidence
- Saying "in today's society"

Sophistication **is**:
- Acknowledging complexity rather than flattening it
- Engaging with the strongest version of the opposing view
- Qualifying your claims when honesty demands it
- Connecting your specific argument to a broader context or tension

### The Four Sophistication Moves

Read each move and the example that follows. All examples use the failure prompt.

---

**Move 1: The Genuine Counterargument**

Do not just mention the other side — engage with it seriously. Show why a reasonable person might disagree, and explain why your position holds despite that challenge.

> *Weak:* "Some people might say failure is not necessary, but they are wrong because many successful people have failed."
>
> *Strong:* "The claim that failure is necessary for success carries an uncomfortable implication: that those who succeed without significant failure somehow achieved less, or that those trapped in cycles of poverty and systemic disadvantage simply have not 'learned their lesson' yet. This objection has real force — and it should push us to be more precise. Failure is not inherently valuable. It is valuable only when the person who fails has the resources, support, and opportunity to extract meaning from the experience."

---

**Move 2: The Qualification**

Resist the urge to make absolute claims. "Always," "never," and "all" are almost never true. Show where your argument has limits.

> *Weak:* "Failure is always necessary for success."
>
> *Strong:* "Failure is most necessary in domains where the path to success cannot be fully mapped in advance — innovation, creative work, interpersonal relationships. In domains governed by clear, known rules — arithmetic, assembly-line procedures, standardized protocols — failure is simply error, and the most successful approach is to avoid it entirely."

---

**Move 3: The Broader Context**

Connect your argument to a larger tension, pattern, or cultural moment.

> *Strong:* "America's relationship with failure is paradoxical: we celebrate it in retrospect ('she failed her way to the top') while punishing it in real time (bankruptcy, academic probation, social stigma). This gap between our mythology of failure and our actual treatment of it suggests that the Ford quotation captures an aspiration more than a reality."

---

**Move 4: The Tension or Complexity**

Instead of resolving every contradiction, name it. Show that the issue is genuinely complicated.

> *Strong:* "The deepest tension in the 'failure is necessary' argument is this: the people best positioned to learn from failure — those with safety nets, second chances, and supportive communities — are also the people who least need failure to succeed. Meanwhile, those for whom failure carries the highest stakes often lack the conditions that would make failure productive. Failure, it turns out, is most educational for those who need the education least."

---

### Your Turn (10 minutes)

1. Choose the strongest body paragraph you have written so far (from Activity 3 or your brainstorming).
2. Pick **one** sophistication move from the list above.
3. Revise your paragraph — or add 2--3 sentences — that incorporate that move.
4. Label which move you used.

### Peer Review (5 minutes)

Trade with a partner. Read their revised paragraph and answer:
- Can you identify which sophistication move they used?
- Does the move feel earned and genuine, or does it feel bolted on?
- Does it strengthen the argument or distract from it?

---

## Practice Prompt

You have built an evidence inventory, sharpened your thesis, practiced commentary, and experimented with sophistication. Time to put it all together.

### The Prompt

Read the following quotation:

> "Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master."
> — Christian Lous Lange, Nobel Peace Prize lecture, 1921

**Write an essay that argues your position on the extent to which technology strengthens or diminishes genuine human connection.**

### Before You Write: Quick Checklist (3 minutes)

Use what you practiced today:

- [ ] Brainstorm at least 6--8 evidence pieces (Activity 1 method)
- [ ] Star your top 3--4
- [ ] Draft a thesis — make sure it is debatable, clear, and specific (Activity 2 criteria)
- [ ] Plan where your commentary will do the heavy lifting (Activity 3)
- [ ] Decide where one sophistication move might fit naturally (Activity 4)

### Write (40 minutes)

Write a complete essay. Aim for a strong introduction with a defensible thesis, 2--3 body paragraphs with specific evidence and developed commentary, and a conclusion that does more than restate your thesis.

---

## Self-Assessment

After writing your practice essay, answer these questions honestly. Circle or highlight your current level for each.

### Thesis (Row 1: 0--1 point)

1. **Does my thesis take a defensible position on the relationship between technology and human connection?** Could a reasonable, informed person argue the opposite of what I claim?
   - No position / just restates the prompt --> 0
   - Clear, debatable position that goes beyond the obvious --> 1

2. **Is my thesis specific enough to guide my essay?** Does it tell the reader what my body paragraphs will need to prove?
   - Vague or generic ("Technology has pros and cons") --> needs revision
   - Specific and directive --> ready

### Evidence and Commentary (Row 2: 0--4 points)

3. **Is my evidence specific and concrete?** Would a reader be able to verify or visualize what I am describing, or am I relying on vague generalizations?
   - Mostly generalizations ("many people use technology") --> 1--2 range
   - Specific, nameable examples with concrete details --> 3--4 range

4. **Does my commentary explain HOW and WHY my evidence supports my thesis?** Or does it just summarize the evidence and move on?
   - Commentary mostly restates the evidence ("This shows that...") --> 1--2 range
   - Commentary explains the mechanism, significance, or implication --> 3--4 range

5. **Do my body paragraphs build on each other?** Does my second paragraph go further than my first, or do they just repeat the same point with different evidence?
   - Paragraphs feel interchangeable --> 1--2 range
   - Clear progression of reasoning --> 3--4 range

### Sophistication (Row 3: 0--1 point)

6. **Did I engage with complexity?** Did I acknowledge a counterargument, qualify a claim, name a tension, or connect my argument to a broader context — and do so in a way that *strengthened* rather than weakened my argument?
   - No engagement with complexity --> 0
   - At least one genuine sophistication move that feels earned --> 1

### My Priorities for Revision

Based on my self-assessment, the **one thing** I most need to improve is:

_____________________________________________________________

## Bridge-Out

You can now analyze sources **and** argue independently. You have built an evidence arsenal from your own knowledge, crafted defensible thesis statements, written commentary that does real analytical work, and experimented with the sophistication moves that separate good essays from great ones.

For the capstone — **Rung 5, the Synthesis essay** — you will combine both skill sets: take a position *and* strategically integrate provided sources to support it. Everything you have learned comes together. You will be selecting the strongest sources from a packet, weaving them into an argument that is *yours*, and using all the tools from Rungs 1 through 4 to do it.

The ladder is almost complete. One more rung.
