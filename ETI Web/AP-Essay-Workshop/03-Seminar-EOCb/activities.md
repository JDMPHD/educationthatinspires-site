# Rung 3: AP Seminar EOCb — Building a Research-Based Argument

---

## Bridge-In

You've spent Rungs 1 and 2 as a **reader** — analyzing what OTHER authors argue and HOW they argue it. Now you switch seats: **you become the author.** You'll build your own argument by pulling together ideas from multiple sources. All those analytical skills? They're now your construction tools.

Here's what you're carrying forward:

- **From Rung 1:** You know how to identify arguments, trace reasoning, and evaluate evidence.
- **From Rung 2:** You know how to analyze rhetorical choices and write structured analytical paragraphs.

**What's new at Rung 3:** You stop describing what others think and start developing what YOU think — backed by source evidence.

## Activity 1 — Source Dialogue

### The Setup

Below are three source excerpts on a debatable topic:

> **Should schools prioritize STEM education over the humanities?**

Read all three carefully. Your job is to figure out how these sources *talk to each other* — where they agree, disagree, and complicate one another.

---

**Source A** — Dr. Lena Torres, "The Innovation Imperative," *Journal of Education Policy* (2023)

> The economic data is difficult to ignore. Students who graduate with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics earn an average of 25% more in their first five years of employment than their peers in humanities fields. As automation reshapes the workforce, the demand for technical literacy will only increase. Schools that fail to prioritize STEM instruction risk leaving students unprepared for the jobs that will actually exist. Investing in STEM is not about devaluing the humanities — it is about recognizing economic reality. Students deserve an education that leads to stable, well-paying careers, and right now, the clearest path to that outcome runs through STEM.

**Source B** — Marcus Whitfield, "What Robots Cannot Do," *The Atlantic* (2024)

> Every major tech company now lists "communication skills" and "critical thinking" as top hiring priorities — skills rooted in the humanities, not the engineering lab. The rush to prioritize STEM has produced graduates who can code an algorithm but struggle to explain what it does or why it matters. History teaches pattern recognition across centuries. Literature builds empathy by forcing readers into unfamiliar perspectives. Philosophy sharpens the ability to construct and dismantle arguments. These are not soft skills — they are the hard skills of a functioning democracy and a thoughtful workforce. Cutting humanities funding to boost STEM budgets is a trade that costs more than it saves.

**Source C** — Dr. Priya Anand, "Beyond the Binary," *Educational Leadership* (2024)

> The STEM-versus-humanities debate is itself the problem. The most pressing challenges of our time — climate change, artificial intelligence ethics, public health communication — demand both technical expertise and humanistic reasoning. A climate scientist who cannot write persuasively will fail to move policy. A philosopher who cannot interpret data will miss the scale of the crisis. Schools should stop treating these disciplines as competitors for funding and start designing curricula that integrate them. The question is not which to prioritize; the question is how to connect them so students can think across boundaries.

### Your Task: Create a Source Conversation Map

Use the template below. Fill in every cell.

| | **Source A** (Torres) | **Source B** (Whitfield) | **Source C** (Anand) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Main claim (one sentence)** | | | |
| **What kind of evidence does this source rely on?** | | | |
| **Where does this source AGREE with another source?** | | | |
| **Where does this source DISAGREE with or PUSH BACK on another source?** | | | |
| **What does this source MISS or leave out?** | | | |

After completing the map, answer this question in 2-3 sentences:

> **What's the biggest tension across these three sources?** Don't just say "they disagree." Name the specific tension — what's really at stake in this debate?

---

## Activity 2 — Finding Your Perspective

You've mapped how the sources talk to each other. Now: **What do YOU think?**

### Step 1: Write Three Different Thesis Statements

Using the same STEM vs. humanities sources, draft three possible thesis statements. Each one should take a **different angle** on the issue. Push yourself — don't write the same idea three ways.

1. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
2. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
3. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Step 2: Choose the Strongest One

Circle or highlight your best thesis. Then answer these questions:

- **Why is this thesis stronger than the other two?**
- **Does it go beyond simply agreeing with one source?** (If your thesis could be replaced by a direct quote from Source A, B, or C, it's not yours yet.)
- **Can you support it with evidence from at least two of the sources?**

### What Makes a "Student-Driven" Perspective?

This is the single most important concept in EOCb scoring. Here's what separates a student-driven perspective from a summary:

| **Summary / Source-Driven** | **Student-Driven Perspective** |
|---|---|
| "Source A argues STEM matters, and Source B argues humanities matter." | "The real failure in education is not underfunding STEM or humanities — it is treating curriculum design as a zero-sum budget fight when the actual skill gap is interdisciplinary thinking." |
| Restates what sources say | Uses sources to support what YOU say |
| Your voice disappears behind the sources | Your voice is the engine; sources are the fuel |
| Reads like a report | Reads like an argument |

**The test:** If you removed the sources entirely, would your thesis still make sense as a standalone claim? If yes, you have a student-driven perspective. If no, you're still summarizing.

---

## Activity 3 — Building the Argument Architecture

You have a thesis. Now you need a structure that makes your argument *move* — claim by claim, with evidence doing real work at every step.

### The Outline Template

Use this framework to plan your argument on the STEM vs. humanities topic.

```
THESIS:
[Your thesis statement from Activity 2]

CLAIM 1: [First reason your thesis is true]
  - Evidence: [Source ___, quote or paraphrase]
  - Commentary: [How does this evidence support YOUR claim — not just what the source says, but what it means for your argument?]

CLAIM 2: [Second reason your thesis is true]
  - Evidence: [Source ___, quote or paraphrase]
  - Commentary: [Connect this evidence to your thesis. What work is it doing?]

CLAIM 3 (optional): [Third reason OR a complication / qualification]
  - Evidence: [Source ___, quote or paraphrase]
  - Commentary: [Why does this matter?]

COUNTERARGUMENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
  - What would someone who disagrees say?
  - How do you respond? (Concede partially? Refute? Reframe?)
```

### Model Outline (Completed Example)

Here's what a completed outline looks like for this topic. Study it — notice how every claim connects back to the thesis, and every piece of evidence gets commentary.

```
THESIS: Schools should stop debating whether to prioritize STEM or
humanities and instead redesign curricula around interdisciplinary
problem-solving, because the challenges students will face after
graduation do not respect disciplinary boundaries.

CLAIM 1: The strongest workforce skills combine technical and
humanistic abilities, which means neither discipline alone is sufficient.
  - Evidence: Whitfield (Source B) notes that major tech companies
    list "communication skills" and "critical thinking" as top
    hiring priorities — skills that come from humanities training,
    not just technical coursework.
  - Commentary: This is significant because it undermines Torres's
    economic argument from within the STEM sector itself. If STEM
    employers are asking for humanities skills, then prioritizing
    STEM at the expense of humanities actually weakens STEM
    graduates. The skills are interdependent, not competing.

CLAIM 2: Real-world problems — the ones students will inherit —
require thinking that crosses disciplinary lines.
  - Evidence: Anand (Source C) argues that challenges like climate
    change and AI ethics "demand both technical expertise and
    humanistic reasoning" and gives the example of a climate
    scientist who cannot write persuasively failing to influence
    policy.
  - Commentary: Anand's example reveals that the cost of
    disciplinary silos is not abstract — it shows up as policy
    failures, communication breakdowns, and missed opportunities.
    If schools train students in only one mode of thinking, those
    students will hit a ceiling the moment their work requires the
    other.

CLAIM 3: The economic argument for STEM, while real, is too narrow
to serve as the basis for educational priorities.
  - Evidence: Torres (Source A) points to a 25% earnings advantage
    for STEM graduates in their first five years.
  - Commentary: Torres's data is limited to early-career earnings
    and does not account for long-term career trajectories,
    job satisfaction, or the many STEM roles that stagnate
    without communication and leadership skills. Using short-term
    salary data to set long-term educational priorities is like
    choosing a career based entirely on the starting salary — it
    ignores everything that matters after year five.

COUNTERARGUMENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
  - Opponents might argue that interdisciplinary curricula sound
    appealing in theory but are impractical: schools have limited
    budgets and time, and students need depth in at least one area.
  - Response: This is a fair logistical concern, but it confuses
    integration with dilution. Interdisciplinary design does not
    mean teaching everything superficially — it means connecting
    existing courses so students practice applying skills across
    contexts. A history class that includes data analysis or a
    physics class that requires persuasive writing costs very
    little but changes how students think.
```

### Now Build Yours

Fill in the outline template with your own thesis and claims. Requirements:

- At least **2 sources** must appear as evidence
- Every piece of evidence must have **commentary** (no drop-in quotes)
- Include at least one **counterargument acknowledgment**

---

## Activity 4 — Commentary Upgrade

The difference between a mediocre EOCb response and a strong one almost always comes down to **commentary** — what you say AFTER you present evidence. Let's train your eye.

### Three Body Paragraphs, Three Levels

Read each paragraph below. All three use the same evidence. The difference is in the commentary.

---

**Paragraph 1 (Summary-Heavy)**

> Schools should focus on STEM because it leads to better jobs. Torres writes that "students who graduate with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics earn an average of 25% more in their first five years of employment." This shows that STEM is more valuable. Whitfield disagrees and says humanities skills like communication are important too. Both authors make good points about education.

**What's wrong here?** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**Paragraph 2 (Adequate Commentary)**

> One reason schools should integrate STEM and humanities is that the job market values both. Torres points out that STEM graduates earn 25% more in their first five years, which suggests a clear economic advantage. However, Whitfield counters that tech companies actually prioritize communication and critical thinking — humanities-rooted skills. This tension shows that the debate is not as simple as one side winning. Students may need training in both areas to succeed in modern careers.

**What's working? What could still improve?** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

**Paragraph 3 (Strong Commentary)**

> The economic case for STEM education, while compelling on the surface, actually reveals why interdisciplinary training is necessary. Torres cites a 25% earnings advantage for STEM graduates in their first five years — a statistic that measures starting salaries but says nothing about long-term career growth or the skills that drive promotion. Whitfield exposes the gap in this logic: if the very companies hiring STEM graduates rank communication and critical thinking as top priorities, then the earnings advantage Torres celebrates may have less to do with technical training and more to do with market demand that has not yet caught up with what employers actually need. In other words, STEM jobs pay well today, but the graduates who advance in those jobs will be the ones who can also write, reason ethically, and persuade — skills the humanities have always taught. This is not an argument against STEM; it is an argument against pretending STEM alone is enough.

**What makes this commentary strong?** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

---

### The Commentary Checklist

After studying the three paragraphs, use this checklist for your own writing:

- [ ] My commentary explains what the evidence **means**, not just what it **says**
- [ ] I connect the evidence back to **my thesis**, not just to the source's argument
- [ ] I explain **why this evidence matters** for my specific claim
- [ ] If I use two sources, I explain **how they relate to each other** (not just list them side by side)
- [ ] My voice is louder than the sources' voices in this paragraph

### Now Write Yours

Pick one claim from your outline (Activity 3) and write a **full body paragraph** with strong commentary. Use the checklist above as your guide. Aim for 6-10 sentences.

## Practice Prompt

New topic. New sources. Full EOCb response. Apply everything you've practiced.

### Source Set: Screen Time and Adolescent Well-Being

---

**Source A** — Dr. Hannah Corwin, "The Dose Makes the Poison," *Pediatrics Today* (2024)

> Large-scale studies consistently find that moderate screen time — roughly one to two hours per day — is associated with no measurable decline in adolescent mental health. In fact, teens who use social media moderately report higher levels of social connectedness than those who avoid it entirely. The problem arises at extremes: heavy users (four or more hours daily) show increased rates of anxiety and disrupted sleep, while teens with no digital access report feeling socially isolated. This suggests the conversation should shift from "screens are bad" to a more precise question about thresholds, content, and context. A blanket reduction in screen time may solve one problem while creating another.

**Source B** — James Okafor, "Designed to Addict," *Wired* (2023)

> The moderate-use argument ignores how these platforms are built. Social media companies employ teams of behavioral psychologists whose explicit goal is to maximize time on app. Features like infinite scroll, push notifications, and algorithmic content feeds are not neutral tools — they are persuasion architectures designed to override a user's intention to stop. Telling teenagers to "use screens moderately" is like placing them in a casino and telling them to gamble responsibly. The real question is not how much time teens spend on screens but whether they ever had meaningful control over that time in the first place. Until platforms are regulated to remove addictive design patterns, personal responsibility frameworks will continue to fail.

**Source C** — Dr. Amara Osei, "Missing the Middleman," *Journal of Adolescent Research* (2024)

> Both the pro-moderation and anti-screen camps overlook a critical variable: parental digital literacy. Studies show that adolescents whose parents actively discuss online content, model healthy usage patterns, and set collaborative (not imposed) boundaries report lower rates of screen-related anxiety regardless of total hours used. The most at-risk teens are not necessarily the heaviest users — they are the ones navigating digital spaces without adult guidance. Focusing the debate on screen time as a number distracts from the relational context in which screens are used. A teen spending three hours online with a parent who engages in conversation about what they're seeing is in a fundamentally different situation than a teen spending one hour online in complete isolation.

---

### The Prompt

The relationship between screen time and adolescent well-being is widely debated. Using the three sources provided, develop an argument that presents your own perspective on how schools, families, or policymakers should approach adolescent screen use. Your argument should:

- Present a clear, student-driven perspective (not just a summary of the sources)
- Develop a logical line of reasoning
- Use evidence from at least two of the provided sources with meaningful commentary

**Suggested length:** 600-900 words

---

## Self-Assessment

Before you turn in your practice response (or after you finish drafting), answer these questions honestly. They map directly to how the EOCb rubric evaluates your work.

### Perspective
1. If I removed every source reference from my response, would my thesis and main argument still make sense on their own? Or does my argument collapse without the sources holding it up?

### Line of Reasoning
2. Can I trace a clear path from my thesis through each body paragraph to my conclusion? Does each paragraph build on the one before it, or could I rearrange them in any order without anything changing?

### Evidence and Commentary
3. For each piece of evidence I used: did I explain what it MEANS for my argument, or did I just show that I read the source? Would a reader understand why I included this evidence even without reading the original source?

### Integration
4. When I used more than one source, did I show how they RELATE to each other (tension, agreement, complication), or did I just put them in separate paragraphs and never connect them?

### Overall
5. If I were the reader instead of the writer, would this response convince me? Where would I push back, and have I already anticipated that pushback?

## Bridge-Out

You've just built an argument from provided sources — reading them critically, finding your own angle, and using evidence to back up YOUR claims. That's a major shift from where you started on this ladder.

**But what happens when there IS no source packet?**

In **Rung 4**, you'll learn to argue from your own knowledge and experience — the ultimate test of independent thinking. No sources to lean on, no excerpts to quote. Just your ideas, your evidence, and your ability to reason. Everything you've built so far comes with you. The question becomes: can you do it on your own?
