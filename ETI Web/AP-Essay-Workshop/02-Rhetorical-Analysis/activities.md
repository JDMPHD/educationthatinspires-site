# Rung 2: Rhetorical Analysis Workshop

## Bridge-In

In Rung 1, you learned to identify **what** an author argues and **whether** their evidence works. Now you are stepping up to analyze **how** — the specific rhetorical choices an author makes to persuade. Same close-reading muscles, new analytical lens.

Think of it this way: Rung 1 asked "Is this argument convincing?" Rung 2 asks "What is the author *doing* — line by line, word by word — to *make* it convincing?"

## Activity 1 — Rhetorical Choice Spotter

### Your Toolkit

Before you dive in, familiarize yourself with these common rhetorical strategies. You do not need to find every single one in every passage — but you should be able to recognize them when they appear.

| Strategy | What It Is | What to Look For |
|---|---|---|
| **Imagery** | Language that appeals to the senses (sight, sound, touch, taste, smell) | Concrete, sensory details; descriptive language |
| **Diction** | Word choice — the specific words an author selects | Connotation, formality level, emotionally charged words, technical terms |
| **Syntax / Structure** | How sentences and passages are built | Sentence length, parallelism, lists, fragments, repetition, punctuation choices |
| **Tone** | The author's attitude toward the subject | Shifts in formality, word connotation, level of certainty |
| **Ethos** | Appeal to credibility or authority | Expert references, personal experience, confident or measured voice |
| **Pathos** | Appeal to emotion | Vivid stories, charged language, appeals to values or fears |
| **Logos** | Appeal to logic and reason | Data, cause-effect reasoning, definitions, logical structure |
| **Analogy / Metaphor** | Comparing unlike things to illuminate an idea | "X is like Y," implied comparisons, extended metaphors |
| **Juxtaposition** | Placing contrasting ideas side by side | Opposites, unexpected pairings, before/after structures |

### The Passage

Read the following excerpt from Paul Shepard's *Nature and Madness* (1982). Your job: **annotate every rhetorical choice you can find** using the toolkit above.

> This seed of normal ontogeny is present in all of us. The newborn infant, for example, needs almost continuous association with a mother in a surround of living plants, rich in texture, smell, and motion. The unfiltered, unpolluted air, the flicker of wild birds, real sunshine and rain, mud to be tasted and tree bark to grasp, the sounds of wind and water, the calls of animals and insects as well as human voices — all these are not vague and pleasant amenities for the infant, but the stuff out of which its second grounding, even while in its mother's arms, has begun. The outdoors is also in some sense another inside, a kind of enlivenment of that fetal landscape which is not so constant as once supposed. The surroundings are also that-which-will-be-swallowed, internalized, incorporated as the self.

**Instructions:**

1. Read the passage once for meaning.
2. Read it again with a pen (or highlighter tool). Each time you spot a rhetorical choice, mark it and label it in the margin with the strategy name.
3. For each choice you mark, jot a one-sentence note: what effect does this choice create for the reader?

Try to find **at least six** distinct choices before you look at the model below.

### Completed Annotation Model

Use this to check your work *after* you have done your own annotation. Did you catch these? Did you find others?

**1. Imagery (sensory detail):**
"The unfiltered, unpolluted air, the flicker of wild birds, real sunshine and rain, mud to be tasted and tree bark to grasp, the sounds of wind and water, the calls of animals and insects as well as human voices"
- *Effect:* Shepard appeals to nearly every sense — sight ("flicker of wild birds"), touch ("mud to be tasted and tree bark to grasp"), hearing ("sounds of wind and water," "calls of animals"), smell/taste (implied by "mud to be tasted," "unfiltered, unpolluted air"). This sensory saturation makes the natural world feel immediate and essential, not abstract.

**2. Cumulative Listing / Syntax:**
The long catalogue structure: "The unfiltered, unpolluted air, the flicker of wild birds, real sunshine and rain, mud to be tasted and tree bark to grasp, the sounds of wind and water, the calls of animals and insects as well as human voices"
- *Effect:* The list keeps building without pause, creating a sense of overwhelming abundance. The reader feels the sheer volume of natural stimuli a child needs. The syntax itself enacts the argument — nature is not one thing but an entire environment.

**3. Diction — "stuff" vs. scholarly language:**
"the stuff out of which its second grounding ... has begun" — the plain, blunt word "stuff" appears in a sentence that also uses the technical term "ontogeny."
- *Effect:* Shepard blends scholarly authority with accessible, almost physical language. "Stuff" makes the natural world feel tangible and real, not clinical. The mix of registers creates a tone that is both credible and urgent.

**4. Juxtaposition:**
"The outdoors is also in some sense another inside"
- *Effect:* This paradox forces the reader to rethink the boundary between self and environment. By collapsing the outside/inside distinction, Shepard argues that nature is not separate from human development — it *is* human development.

**5. Metaphor:**
"This seed of normal ontogeny is present in all of us."
- *Effect:* The word "seed" frames healthy development as something natural, organic, already planted within every person. It implies that development, like a plant, requires the right environment to grow — setting up the passage's argument that nature provides that environment.

**6. Tone — scholarly yet passionate:**
The passage moves from clinical precision ("normal ontogeny," "second grounding") to almost poetic intensity ("that-which-will-be-swallowed, internalized, incorporated as the self").
- *Effect:* Shepard establishes ethos through his expertise, but the rising emotional intensity conveys that this is not merely an academic observation — it is an urgent claim about what children need.

**7. Negation as emphasis:**
"all these are *not* vague and pleasant amenities for the infant, *but* the stuff out of which..."
- *Effect:* The "not X, but Y" structure directly challenges a reader who might dismiss nature as a nice-to-have. Shepard reframes nature from optional luxury to developmental necessity.

## Activity 2 — Thesis Builder Workshop

A rhetorical analysis thesis must do more than restate the argument. It must name **specific rhetorical choices** and explain **what they accomplish**.

### The Formula (Training Wheels)

> [Author] uses [rhetorical choice 1], [rhetorical choice 2], and [rhetorical choice 3] to [achieve a specific effect / advance a specific purpose].

This formula is a starting point, not a ceiling. As you get comfortable, you will write thesis statements that move beyond this template.

### Step 1 — Fill in the Blank

Complete this sentence using your annotations from Activity 1:

> In his essay *Nature and Madness*, Paul Shepard uses \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

Write at least **two different versions** by choosing different combinations of rhetorical choices and effects.

### Step 2 — Rank These Thesis Statements

Read the three thesis statements below. Rank them from **weakest (1)** to **strongest (3)**, then discuss with a partner: what makes the strong one strong and the weak one weak?

**Thesis A:**
"Paul Shepard argues that children need nature to develop properly, and he uses a lot of descriptive language and metaphors to make his point."

**Thesis B:**
"Paul Shepard uses imagery, listing, and diction to persuade the reader."

**Thesis C:**
"Through vivid sensory imagery, an accumulating catalogue structure, and a deliberate blend of scholarly and visceral diction, Shepard reframes the natural world not as a pleasant backdrop to childhood but as the raw material of psychological development itself."

---

**Discussion Notes:**

- **Thesis A (Weakest):** This is half-summary ("Shepard argues that children need nature") and half-analysis. "A lot of descriptive language" is vague. The thesis tells us *what* Shepard argues more than *how* he argues it.
- **Thesis B (Middle):** This names specific strategies, which is good. But "to persuade the reader" is too generic — persuade them of *what*? Every author tries to persuade. This thesis does not explain the *effect* of the choices.
- **Thesis C (Strongest):** This names specific, precise strategies ("accumulating catalogue structure," "blend of scholarly and visceral diction") and explains exactly what they accomplish ("reframes the natural world not as a pleasant backdrop to childhood but as the raw material of psychological development"). It also has a sophisticated edge: the "not X but Y" phrasing mirrors Shepard's own rhetorical move.

### Step 3 — Write Your Own

Now write your own thesis statement from scratch — no fill-in-the-blank. Aim for the quality level of Thesis C. Swap with a partner and check:

- [ ] Does it name at least two specific rhetorical choices (not just "rhetorical strategies")?
- [ ] Does it explain the *effect* or *purpose* of those choices (not just "to persuade")?
- [ ] Does it avoid summarizing the argument?

## Activity 3 — The Evidence Sandwich

Strong rhetorical analysis paragraphs follow a reliable structure. Think of it as a sandwich:

```
  ______________________________________
 |          TOPIC SENTENCE               |  <-- Claim about one rhetorical choice
 |_______________________________________|
 |          EVIDENCE (QUOTE)             |  <-- Specific passage from the text
 |_______________________________________|
 |          COMMENTARY                   |  <-- Analyze HOW the quote works
 |          (This is the meat.           |      rhetorically. This is where
 |           Make it thick.)             |      your analysis lives.
 |_______________________________________|
 |          CONNECTION                   |  <-- Link back to your thesis
 |_______________________________________|
```

The most common mistake in rhetorical analysis: **too much evidence, not enough commentary.** Your commentary should be *longer* than your quote. You are not proving that the quote exists — you are explaining what it *does*.

### Commentary vs. Summary: Spot the Difference

Read these two responses to the same quote. Which one is **commentary** and which one is **summary**?

**The quote:**
> "The unfiltered, unpolluted air, the flicker of wild birds, real sunshine and rain, mud to be tasted and tree bark to grasp"

**Response X:**
"Here, Shepard lists many elements of nature that a child experiences, including air, birds, sunshine, rain, mud, and tree bark. He describes the natural environment in detail."

**Response Y:**
"Shepard's catalogue of natural stimuli moves systematically through the senses — from the feel of air, to the sight of birds, to the tactile shock of mud and bark — creating an almost overwhelming accumulation that mirrors the sensory richness he argues children require. The sheer length of the list, piling item upon item without pause, structurally enacts his claim: nature is not a single experience but an immersive environment that surrounds the developing child from every direction."

**Answer:** Response X is **summary** — it restates *what* Shepard says. Response Y is **commentary** — it analyzes *how* the list structure and sensory progression create a specific effect on the reader. Notice that Response Y is also significantly longer than the quote itself.

### Build a Paragraph Together

Using the Shepard passage, let's construct one Evidence Sandwich paragraph as a class. Fill in each layer:

**Topic Sentence** (claim about one rhetorical choice):
> Shepard's use of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ serves to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**Evidence** (quote from the passage — use quotation marks, cite specific language):
> For example, Shepard writes, "\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_."

**Commentary** (analyze HOW this quote works — at least 2-3 sentences):
> This choice is effective because \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The reader experiences \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. By doing this, Shepard \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

**Connection** (link back to thesis/purpose):
> This rhetorical move advances Shepard's larger purpose of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

### Model Paragraph

Here is a complete Evidence Sandwich paragraph you can use as a benchmark for your own writing:

> Shepard's deliberate juxtaposition of outside and inside destabilizes the reader's assumptions about where development happens. He writes that "the outdoors is also in some sense another inside, a kind of enlivenment of that fetal landscape," collapsing the conventional boundary between the child's body and the natural world. The paradox — that what is "outside" is actually "inside" — forces the reader to abandon the comfortable idea that nature is merely a setting, a backdrop separate from the self. Instead, Shepard's language suggests that the natural environment is literally absorbed into the child's identity, as underscored by his final, almost aggressive verbs: "swallowed, internalized, incorporated." Each verb intensifies the previous one, moving from a physical act (swallowing) to a psychological one (internalizing) to a statement of total identity (incorporation — literally, *made into the body*). This rhetorical escalation reinforces Shepard's central claim that nature is not an amenity but a developmental necessity, without which the self remains incomplete.

### Now You Try

Pick a **different** rhetorical choice from your Activity 1 annotations — one that has not been covered in the model paragraph above. Write your own Evidence Sandwich paragraph. Before you turn it in, check:

- [ ] Does my topic sentence make a claim about a rhetorical choice (not just name a topic)?
- [ ] Do I quote specific language from the passage?
- [ ] Is my commentary longer than my quote?
- [ ] Does my commentary explain HOW the choice works, not just WHAT the passage says?
- [ ] Does my final sentence connect back to Shepard's purpose or my thesis?

## Practice Prompt — Timed Essay

Now put it all together. Below is a new passage and a rhetorical analysis prompt. Give yourself **40 minutes** (the approximate timing for the AP Lang rhetorical analysis essay) and write a complete essay.

### The Passage

The following is adapted from a 2019 lecture by cognitive scientist Dr. Anya Mehra on the relationship between technology and sustained attention.

> We speak of paying attention as though it were a simple transaction — I give my focus, I receive understanding. But attention is not a payment. It is a habitat. The mind does not simply *direct* itself toward a task; it *settles into* a task the way an animal settles into a landscape, gradually adjusting its rhythms to the rhythms of the work. Deep reading requires a particular habitat: silence, or near-silence; the absence of urgent signals; a willingness to be bored for the first five minutes before the text begins to generate its own momentum. What our devices have done is not so much to weaken attention as to destroy its habitat. The notification, the vibration in the pocket, the small red badge on the screen — these are not distractions in the way a loud noise is a distraction. A loud noise is a single interruption. A notification is an invitation to an entirely different world, one algorithmically designed to be more immediately rewarding than whatever you are currently doing. To read deeply in the presence of a smartphone is like trying to sleep in a room where someone keeps opening the door to show you something interesting. It can be done, but it requires an unnatural act of will, a constant reassertion of purpose that is itself exhausting. The mind, like any creature, will eventually abandon a habitat that no longer supports its life.

### The Prompt

Write an essay that analyzes the rhetorical choices Dr. Mehra makes to convey her argument about technology and sustained attention. In your essay, consider such rhetorical elements as imagery, analogy, diction, structure, and tone.

**Reminders:**
- Your thesis should identify specific rhetorical choices and their effects — not just restate Mehra's argument.
- Use the Evidence Sandwich structure for each body paragraph.
- Your commentary should be longer than your evidence.
- Aim for at least three body paragraphs, each focused on a different rhetorical choice.

## Self-Assessment Checklist

After you finish your practice essay, evaluate your own work honestly. Circle the score you think you earned in each category.

### Thesis (0-1 point)

| Score | Description | Check Yourself |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | No thesis, or thesis only restates the argument ("Mehra argues that phones are bad for attention") | Did I just summarize what she says? |
| 1 | Thesis identifies specific rhetorical choices AND explains their effect/purpose | Did I name at least two specific strategies and say what they accomplish? |

**My thesis score: ____**

### Evidence and Commentary (0-4 points)

| Score | Description | Check Yourself |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Evidence is vague or missing; commentary is mostly summary | Did I quote specific language? Or did I just gesture at the passage? |
| 2 | Some specific evidence; commentary is uneven — sometimes analytical, sometimes summary | Do some of my paragraphs explain HOW while others just explain WHAT? |
| 3 | Specific evidence throughout; commentary is mostly analytical but may lack consistency or depth in places | Is my commentary consistently explaining the rhetorical effect, not just identifying the strategy? |
| 4 | Specific, well-chosen evidence; commentary is consistently analytical, well-developed, and clearly connected to the thesis | Is every paragraph a strong Evidence Sandwich? Is my commentary always longer than my quotes? |

**My evidence/commentary score: ____**

### Sophistication (0-1 point)

| Score | Description | Check Yourself |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Analysis is straightforward; treats each rhetorical choice in isolation | Did I just go through a checklist of strategies? |
| 1 | Analysis shows nuance: explains how choices work *together*, acknowledges complexity, uses precise language, or explores tensions in the text | Did I connect strategies to each other? Did I notice something surprising or complex about how the rhetoric works? |

**My sophistication score: ____**

**Total: ____ / 6**

### Reflection Questions

1. Which Evidence Sandwich paragraph is your strongest? What makes it strong?
2. Which paragraph needs the most revision? What specifically would you change?
3. Look at your commentary sentences. Highlight every sentence that explains HOW a rhetorical choice works. Now highlight every sentence that summarizes WHAT the passage says. What is the ratio? (Aim for at least 3:1 commentary-to-summary.)
4. Did your thesis evolve as you wrote, or did you stick with your original? (Strong writers often revise their thesis after drafting — that is normal and good.)

## Bridge-Out

You can now analyze how **other** writers build arguments — identifying the specific rhetorical choices they make and explaining how those choices work on a reader. This is one of the most transferable skills you will learn: it applies to speeches, articles, ads, films, and any situation where someone is trying to move an audience.

**Next up in Rung 3:** You will build your **own** argument using multiple sources — synthesizing evidence from different texts into a cohesive, persuasive essay. You are moving from the passenger seat to the driver's seat.
