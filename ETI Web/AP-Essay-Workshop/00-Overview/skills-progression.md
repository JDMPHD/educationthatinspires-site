# AP Essay Workshop: Pedagogical Ladder — Skills Progression

## The Ladder at a Glance

| Rung | Essay Type | Core Skill Focus | What's New at This Level |
|------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1 | **EOCa** (Seminar) | Source analysis with guided questions | Identify argument, trace reasoning, evaluate evidence |
| 2 | **Rhetorical Analysis** (Lang) | Analyze *how* an author builds an argument | Rhetorical choices, essay-length analytical writing |
| 3 | **EOCb** (Seminar) | Build a research-based argument from sources | Student-driven perspective, multi-source synthesis |
| 4 | **Argument** (Lang) | Construct an argument from own knowledge | Independent evidence selection, counterargument |
| 5 | **Synthesis** (Lang) | Integrate provided sources into original argument | Strategic source selection, full integration of all prior skills |

## Skills Map

### Rung 1: EOCa — Guided Source Analysis
**You are learning to:** read a source carefully and respond to specific analytical questions.

**Skills introduced:**
- Identify an author's argument, main idea, or thesis
- Trace a line of reasoning (claims and how they connect)
- Evaluate the effectiveness of evidence
- Distinguish between summary and analysis

**Bridge to Rung 2:** You can now *identify* what an author is doing. Next, you'll learn to analyze *how* they do it — and write a full essay about it.

---

### Rung 2: Rhetorical Analysis — Analyzing the How
**You are learning to:** write a full essay that analyzes the rhetorical choices an author makes.

**Skills introduced:**
- Identify rhetorical strategies (imagery, diction, structure, tone, appeals)
- Write a thesis that names specific choices and their effects
- Build body paragraphs: evidence → commentary → connection to thesis
- Sustain a line of reasoning across multiple paragraphs

**Skills carried from Rung 1:** Identifying argument, tracing reasoning, evaluating evidence

**Scoring framework:** Thesis (0–1) + Evidence/Commentary (0–4) + Sophistication (0–1) = 6 points

**Bridge to Rung 3:** You can now analyze *someone else's* argument in depth. Next, you'll build your *own* argument using multiple sources.

---

### Rung 3: EOCb — Research-Based Argument
**You are learning to:** construct your own argument by synthesizing ideas from multiple sources.

**Skills introduced:**
- Develop and sustain a student-driven perspective/thesis
- Synthesize evidence from multiple sources into a coherent argument
- Write commentary that connects source evidence to your own claims
- Maintain a clear, logical line of reasoning across an extended response

**Skills carried from Rungs 1–2:** Source analysis, identifying rhetorical strategies, paragraph construction, evidence evaluation

**Bridge to Rung 4:** You've built arguments from *provided* sources. Next, you'll argue from your *own* knowledge and experience — no source packet to lean on.

---

### Rung 4: Lang Argument — Independent Argumentation
**You are learning to:** build a persuasive argument using evidence drawn from your own reading, observation, and experience.

**Skills introduced:**
- Craft a defensible thesis that takes a clear position
- Select and deploy evidence from personal knowledge (reading, history, current events, experience)
- Engage with complexity: counterarguments, qualifications, nuance
- Write commentary that does analytical work (not just illustration)

**Skills carried from Rungs 1–3:** Thesis construction, line of reasoning, evidence-commentary structure, synthesis thinking

**Scoring framework:** Thesis (0–1) + Evidence/Commentary (0–4) + Sophistication (0–1) = 6 points

**Bridge to Rung 5:** You can now argue independently *and* work with sources. The capstone combines both: you'll take a position and strategically integrate provided sources to support it.

---

### Rung 5: Lang Synthesis — The Capstone
**You are learning to:** take a position on an issue and support it by strategically selecting and integrating evidence from a provided source set.

**Skills introduced:**
- Strategic source selection (choose the best 3+ from 6–7 provided)
- Integration techniques: direct quotation, paraphrase, and summary
- Attribution and citation within a flowing argument
- Sophistication: tension between sources, qualification, complexity

**Skills carried from all prior Rungs:**
- Source analysis and evidence evaluation (Rung 1)
- Rhetorical awareness and paragraph craft (Rung 2)
- Multi-source synthesis and student perspective (Rung 3)
- Independent argumentation and counterargument (Rung 4)

**Scoring framework:** Thesis (0–1) + Evidence/Commentary (0–4) + Sophistication (0–1) = 6 points

## How the Bridges Work

Each workshop opens with an **explicit bridge** that:
1. **Looks back** — names the specific skills from the previous rung that students will carry forward
2. **Names the gap** — identifies what students can't yet do that this rung will teach
3. **Looks ahead** — previews how today's new skills feed into the next level

This ensures students always know *where they are* on the ladder and *why* each skill matters.

## Workshop Format (All Rungs)

Each workshop contains:
- **Bridge-In** — Connection to prior skills + preview of new skills
- **Skill-Building Activities** — 2–3 scaffolded exercises that build the rung's target skills
- **Practice Prompt** — A full timed-practice opportunity
- **Peer/Self-Assessment** — Rubric-aligned reflection questions
- **Bridge-Out** — Preview of next rung
