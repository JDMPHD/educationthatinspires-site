# Rung 5: The Synthesis Essay — The Summit

## Bridge-In

This is it — the summit. Every skill you have built is about to come together.

- **Rung 1** taught you to read sources critically — to figure out what a source actually says, what it assumes, and how reliable it is.
- **Rung 2** taught you to analyze how arguments work — to see the rhetorical moves writers make and explain *why* those moves matter.
- **Rung 3** taught you to build arguments from sources — to take someone else's evidence and put it to work inside your own reasoning.
- **Rung 4** taught you to argue from your own knowledge — to stake a claim and defend it with logic, examples, and conviction.

Now? You do ALL of it at once. You take a position on a complex issue, choose your best sources from a provided set, weave them into YOUR argument, and make the whole thing sophisticated. This is the synthesis essay — the full package.

The AP Lang Synthesis rubric scores you on three things:

| Category | Points | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **Thesis** | 0--1 | A defensible position that directly responds to the prompt |
| **Evidence & Commentary** | 0--4 | Use evidence from at least 3 sources, clearly attributed. Top scores require specific evidence *plus* commentary that consistently explains how evidence supports your line of reasoning |
| **Sophistication** | 0--1 | A nuanced argument that engages with complexity and avoids oversimplification |

**Total: 6 points**

You already know how to do each of these things individually. Today you learn to do them all at once, under pressure, with purpose.

## Activity 1 — Strategic Source Triage

### The Scenario

You have just been handed a synthesis prompt. Before you write a single word of your essay, you need to *read strategically*. Not every source will make it into your essay. Your job is to triage: read fast, think critically, and decide which sources earn a spot in your argument.

### The Prompt

**Should governments regulate social media platforms to protect public mental health?**

Read the six sources below. Then complete the Source Triage Chart that follows.

---

**Source A — Public Health Data**

A 2023 report from the National Institute of Mental Health found that adolescents who spend more than three hours daily on social media are twice as likely to report symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those who spend less than one hour. Emergency room visits for self-harm among teens aged 13--17 rose 45% between 2015 and 2022, a period that closely tracks the mass adoption of image-based platforms. Researchers caution that correlation does not prove causation, but describe the parallel trends as "deeply concerning and worthy of policy attention."

**Source B — Technology Industry Perspective**

Maria Chen, Vice President of Policy at a major social media company, testified before Congress: "Our platforms connect billions of people and provide vital spaces for community, creativity, and support — especially for marginalized youth who may lack safe offline spaces. Regulation that restricts access or mandates content changes risks silencing vulnerable voices. We believe the industry can self-regulate through improved parental controls, transparency reports, and voluntary mental health partnerships. Government intervention is a blunt instrument for a nuanced problem."

**Source C — Personal Narrative**

When I was fifteen, I deleted every social media app from my phone for six months. The first two weeks were miserable — I felt invisible, cut off from inside jokes and group plans. But by month three, something shifted. I slept better. I stopped comparing my body to strangers' photos. I read eleven books. When I came back online, I was choosier about what I followed and how long I scrolled. Nobody forced me off those apps. I chose to leave, and that choice mattered more than any rule could have. Not everyone needs a law to protect them — some of us just need a wake-up call.

**Source D — Counterargument / Civil Liberties**

The American Civil Liberties Union has raised concerns about social media regulation, arguing that government oversight of online platforms risks infringing on First Amendment rights. "History shows that content regulation disproportionately silences dissenting, minority, and politically unpopular voices," the organization stated in a 2023 policy brief. The ACLU warns that well-intentioned mental health regulations could grant governments broad censorship powers, particularly if the definition of "harmful content" is left vague or politically influenced.

**Source E — Policy Proposal**

The proposed Digital Wellness Act would require social media companies to disable algorithmic recommendation systems for users under 16, provide default screen-time notifications, and submit to independent annual audits of their platforms' effects on youth mental health. Sponsors describe the bill as a "seatbelt, not a ban" — a structural safeguard that preserves user freedom while reducing passive exposure to harmful content. Critics counter that age verification is technically unreliable and that the bill's audit requirements could burden smaller platforms disproportionately.

**Source F — Historical Parallel**

In the early twentieth century, public outcry over unsafe food and deceptive labeling led to the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 — landmark regulation that manufacturers initially called catastrophic for business. Critics warned that government meddling would stifle innovation and raise costs. Instead, the law created a baseline of safety that ultimately strengthened consumer trust and industry growth. Today, few argue that food should be entirely unregulated. The question is whether digital platforms — which shape the psychological diets of billions — deserve a similar framework of accountability.

### Source Triage Chart

Before you fill this in, pause and ask yourself: **What is my gut reaction to this prompt? Do I lean toward supporting regulation, opposing it, or something more nuanced?** Write one sentence capturing your initial position.

My emerging position: _______________________________________________________________

Now triage each source:

| Source | Main Claim (1 sentence) | Relationship to My Position: Support / Challenge / Complicate? | Would I Use It? Why or Why Not? |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Public Health Data | | | |
| B — Tech Industry | | | |
| C — Personal Narrative | | | |
| D — Civil Liberties | | | |
| E — Policy Proposal | | | |
| F — Historical Parallel | | | |

### After You Triage

Answer these three questions:

1. **Which 3--4 sources made your "use" list?** Write them here: ___________________________
2. **Did you include at least one source that challenges or complicates your position?** (You should. Synthesis essays that only use agreeing sources rarely earn the Sophistication point.)
3. **Is there a source you initially dismissed but now see a use for — even as a counterargument to address and refute?**

**Key Insight:** Strong synthesis writers do not just grab sources that agree with them. They select sources *strategically* — choosing evidence that supports, evidence that lets them show nuance by addressing the other side, and evidence that adds a different dimension to the conversation.

## Activity 2 — Integration Techniques Workshop

You know you need to use sources. But *how* you bring a source into your writing matters enormously. A source dropped into a paragraph without context or connection is like a brick thrown through a window — it arrives, but it does damage instead of building something.

There are three ways to integrate sources: **direct quotation**, **paraphrase**, and **summary**. Each has a purpose.

### The Three Techniques

**Direct Quotation** — Use the source's exact words, in quotation marks.

> According to the ACLU, "content regulation disproportionately silences dissenting, minority, and politically unpopular voices" (Source D).

*Use when:* The original wording is powerful, precise, or memorable. When the exact language matters — legal phrasing, a striking metaphor, a key statistic stated in a specific way.

**Paraphrase** — Restate the source's idea in your own words, at roughly the same level of detail.

> The ACLU cautions that regulating what appears on social media could give governments the power to suppress viewpoints that are unpopular or politically inconvenient (Source D).

*Use when:* The idea matters more than the exact wording. When you want to maintain your own voice and flow. When the original phrasing is technical or awkward.

**Summary** — Condense the source's broader argument into a shorter version.

> Civil liberties advocates warn that social media regulation, however well-intentioned, risks becoming a tool for censorship (Source D).

*Use when:* You need the big picture, not the details. When a source's overall position matters for your argument but you do not need to dwell on specifics.

### Quick-Reference Decision Guide

Ask yourself:

- **Are the exact words essential?** Quote.
- **Is the idea important but the wording is not special?** Paraphrase.
- **Do I just need the gist to set up my own point?** Summarize.

**Rule of thumb:** Paraphrase is your default. Quote only when the language itself does real work. Summarize when you need to move quickly.

### Fix the Bad Integration

Below is a paragraph with three common integration errors. Read it, identify what is wrong, and rewrite it to fix the problems.

> Social media is bad for teens. "Adolescents who spend more than three hours daily on social media are twice as likely to report symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those who spend less than one hour." Also the Digital Wellness Act would require social media companies to disable algorithmic recommendation systems for users under 16, provide default screen-time notifications, and submit to independent annual audits of their platforms' effects on youth mental health. So clearly the government should regulate social media.

**What is wrong here? Find at least three problems:**

1. ________________________________________________________________________
2. ________________________________________________________________________
3. ________________________________________________________________________

**Now rewrite the paragraph** so that it:
- Has a clear topic sentence driven by the student's own claim
- Integrates the evidence smoothly (with attribution)
- Includes commentary explaining how the evidence supports the claim

Your rewrite:

_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

### Common Errors Checklist

After you rewrite, confirm you avoided these:

- [ ] **Dropped quote** — a quotation appears with no introduction or attribution
- [ ] **No source tag** — the reader cannot tell where the evidence came from
- [ ] **Source takeover** — the source's words fill most of the paragraph and the student's voice disappears
- [ ] **Quote-and-run** — evidence appears but is never explained or connected to the argument
- [ ] **Patchwork plagiarism** — the "paraphrase" follows the original sentence structure too closely with a few swapped words

---

## Activity 3 — The Synthesis Paragraph

This is the single most important skill in the synthesis essay. Everything else — your thesis, your outline, your source selection — leads to this: **can you write a paragraph where YOUR argument drives the bus and sources ride as passengers?**

### Source Report vs. Synthesis: See the Difference

**Source Report Paragraph (WEAK):**

> Source A says that teens who spend more than three hours on social media are twice as likely to experience anxiety and depression. Source E describes the Digital Wellness Act, which would turn off algorithms for kids under 16. Source F talks about how food regulation in 1906 helped consumers and did not destroy the industry.

What is wrong with this? The student has vanished. There is no claim, no argument, no reasoning — just a list of what sources say. The sources are driving. The student is just along for the ride.

**Synthesis Paragraph (STRONG):**

> Government regulation of social media is justified when platforms cause measurable harm that individuals cannot reasonably avoid on their own. National health data reveals that teens spending more than three hours daily on social media face double the risk of anxiety and depression symptoms, a trend that has worsened alongside platform growth (Source A). This is not a matter of personal willpower — algorithmic systems are specifically designed to maximize engagement, making "just log off" an inadequate response to a structural problem. The Digital Wellness Act recognizes this by targeting the algorithms themselves rather than restricting user access, functioning as what its sponsors call "a seatbelt, not a ban" (Source E). History supports this approach: early twentieth-century food safety regulation faced identical accusations of government overreach, yet ultimately strengthened both public health and industry credibility (Source F). When the harm is systemic, the response must be structural.

**What makes the strong version work?**
- The student's claim opens and closes the paragraph
- Each source is *introduced by* the student's reasoning, not the other way around
- Commentary after each piece of evidence explains *why* it matters to the argument
- Multiple sources are woven together to build a single, unified point

### Now You Try

Write one synthesis paragraph using **two sources** from the set in Activity 1. Your paragraph should argue a specific sub-claim that supports your overall position.

Before you write, plan:

- My sub-claim for this paragraph: ________________________________________________
- Source I will use first: __________ How I will use it (quote / paraphrase / summary): __________
- Source I will use second: __________ How I will use it (quote / paraphrase / summary): __________
- My commentary will explain: ____________________________________________________

**Write your paragraph here:**

_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

### Paragraph Self-Check

Read your paragraph back and answer honestly:

| Question | Yes / No |
|---|---|
| Does your own claim appear in the first or second sentence? | |
| Could a reader identify your argument even if the source evidence disappeared? | |
| Is every source clearly attributed (by name, letter, or description)? | |
| Does at least one sentence of commentary follow each piece of evidence? | |
| Does the paragraph end with YOUR reasoning, not a source's words? | |

If you answered "No" to any question, revise before moving on.

## Activity 4 — Full Outline With Sources Mapped

You have triaged your sources, practiced integration, and written a synthesis paragraph. Now zoom out and plan the whole essay. A strong synthesis essay is not written paragraph by paragraph — it is *architected* so that each section does specific work and the sources land where they will have the most impact.

### Model Completed Outline

Below is an example of a completed outline so you can see what a fully mapped plan looks like. **This represents ONE possible approach — yours will differ.**

**THESIS:** While social media regulation raises legitimate concerns about free expression, the scale of documented harm to adolescent mental health demands structural safeguards that go beyond voluntary industry measures.

**BODY 1 — The harm is real and measurable**
- Sub-claim: Data shows a clear and worsening link between heavy social media use and adolescent mental health decline.
- Source A (paraphrase): teens 2x more likely to report anxiety/depression; ER visits for self-harm up 45%
- Source C (summary): even a teen who personally benefited from quitting acknowledges the pull of these platforms
- Commentary: The scale of the trend — millions of adolescents, a decade of worsening outcomes — moves this beyond individual choice into public health territory.
- Connection to thesis: Structural problems require structural solutions.

**BODY 2 — Smart regulation is possible without censorship**
- Sub-claim: Well-designed policy can target platform mechanics without restricting speech.
- Source E (quote): "a seatbelt, not a ban" — targets algorithms, not content
- Commentary: Disabling recommendation algorithms for minors does not remove any content; it simply stops the machine from force-feeding it. This distinction answers the censorship objection directly.
- Connection to thesis: This proves structural safeguards can coexist with free expression.

**BODY 3 — Counterargument and rebuttal**
- Counterargument: Regulation could become a censorship tool.
- Source D (paraphrase): ACLU warns that vague definitions of "harmful content" risk political abuse
- Rebuttal: This concern is valid but addressable — the Digital Wellness Act targets platform design, not content. Historical precedent shows regulation can be precise.
- Source F (summary): Food safety regulation faced identical objections and ultimately strengthened both safety and industry.
- Connection to thesis: Acknowledging the risk while showing it can be managed reinforces the argument for thoughtful regulation.

**CONCLUSION:** The question is not whether to act but how to act wisely. The evidence, the precedents, and the available policy tools all point toward regulation that protects without silencing.

## Practice Prompt — Full Synthesis Essay

You are ready. Below is a complete AP-style synthesis prompt with a new topic and six new sources. This is your chance to put every skill together — source triage, integration, synthesis paragraphing, outlining, and full essay writing.

---

### Prompt

**What is the proper role of technology in K--12 education?**

The increasing presence of digital tools — laptops, tablets, educational software, artificial intelligence tutors — in K--12 classrooms has sparked debate about what technology should and should not do in schools. Some see technology as a transformative force for personalized learning, while others warn it is displacing essential human elements of education.

Read the following six sources carefully. Then write an essay that synthesizes material from at least three of the sources and develops your position on the proper role of technology in K--12 education.

In your response you should do the following:
- Respond to the prompt with a thesis that presents a defensible position.
- Select and use evidence from at least three of the provided sources to support your line of reasoning. Indicate clearly which sources you are referring to.
- Explain how the evidence supports your line of reasoning.
- Use appropriate grammar and punctuation in communicating your argument.

---

**Source 1 — Research Data**

A five-year longitudinal study conducted across 200 U.S. school districts found that students in classrooms using adaptive learning software for math showed a 12% average improvement in standardized test scores compared to control groups using traditional instruction alone. However, the gains were concentrated among students in middle-performance bands; the highest- and lowest-performing students showed no statistically significant improvement. Researchers noted that the software was most effective when used alongside direct teacher instruction — not as a replacement for it. Districts that replaced teacher-led lessons with software-only modules saw flat or declining performance.

**Source 2 — Educator Perspective**

Jamal Worthing, a high school English teacher with 22 years of experience, writes: "I have watched three waves of 'revolutionary' education technology wash through my classroom. Each one promised transformation. What I have learned is this: technology is a spectacular delivery system, but it cannot teach a student to care about a poem, to listen to a classmate's grief during a discussion of memoir, or to find their own voice in an essay. The things that matter most in my classroom happen in the silence after a question, in the look on a student's face when they finally understand. No screen replicates that. Use the tools, yes. But never confuse the tool for the teaching."

**Source 3 — Student Experience**

During the pandemic, I did online school for fourteen months. At first I liked it — I could wake up late, rewatch lectures, and work at my own pace. But by month six I realized I had not raised my hand in a live discussion once. I had not worked through a hard problem with a partner. My teachers were thumbnails on a screen. When I came back to in-person classes, I felt like I had forgotten how to be a student in a room with other people. Technology kept me connected to content. It completely disconnected me from the experience of learning.

**Source 4 — Equity and Access Argument**

The Education Trust reports that in low-income school districts, one-to-one device programs have significantly narrowed the "homework gap" — the disparity between students who have home access to technology and those who do not. Before device distribution, 34% of students in surveyed districts reported being unable to complete online assignments at home. After distribution and broadband partnerships, that figure dropped to 8%. Advocates argue that technology is not a luxury in modern education but a baseline equity issue: without access, students in under-resourced communities fall further behind in digital literacy, college readiness, and workforce preparation.

**Source 5 — Neuroscience Caution**

Cognitive scientist Dr. Priya Mehta argues that the rapid adoption of screens in classrooms overlooks critical evidence about how young brains learn. "Sustained attention, deep reading, and the ability to hold complex ideas in working memory are all skills that develop through practice — particularly through slow, focused engagement with print text and face-to-face dialogue," Mehta writes. Her research shows that students who primarily read on screens demonstrate lower comprehension of long-form texts and weaker retention after 48 hours compared to students who read the same material in print. She recommends a "balanced cognitive diet" that limits screen-based instruction to no more than 40% of classroom time for students under age 14.

**Source 6 — International Policy Model**

Estonia, frequently cited as a global leader in digital education, introduced a national coding curriculum for all students beginning in first grade in 2012. By 2023, Estonian students ranked first in Europe on the PISA assessment in reading, math, and science. However, analysts caution against attributing these results solely to technology. Estonia simultaneously invested in small class sizes, extensive teacher training, and a cultural emphasis on education as civic duty. The technology was embedded within a broader pedagogical ecosystem rather than deployed as a standalone solution. "The computer is not the teacher," said Estonia's former education minister. "The teacher is the teacher. The computer is a pencil that thinks."

**Space for Source Triage (use your chart from Activity 1 as a model):**

| Source | Main Claim | Support / Challenge / Complicate? | Use It? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — Research Data | | | |
| 2 — Educator | | | |
| 3 — Student Experience | | | |
| 4 — Equity & Access | | | |
| 5 — Neuroscience | | | |
| 6 — International Model | | | |

**Outline your essay before drafting.** Use the template from Activity 4.

**Then write your full essay.** Aim for 5--6 paragraphs. You have 40 minutes, just like on the AP exam.

## Self-Assessment — Rubric-Aligned Reflection

After you finish your practice essay, answer each question honestly. Be specific — vague self-assessment does not help you improve.

### Thesis (0--1 point)

1. **Copy your thesis statement here.** Does it present a clear, defensible position that directly responds to the prompt — not just a fact, not just a topic, but an arguable *claim*? Would a reasonable person be able to disagree with your thesis?

   _________________________________________________________________________
   _________________________________________________________________________

### Evidence and Commentary (0--4 points)

2. **List every source you used and how you used it.** For each, note whether you quoted, paraphrased, or summarized. Did you use at least three sources?

   | Source | How I Used It | Quote / Paraphrase / Summary |
   |---|---|---|
   | | | |
   | | | |
   | | | |
   | | | |

3. **Find your strongest moment of commentary** — the place where you best explained *how* a piece of evidence supports your reasoning. Copy it here. What makes it effective?

   _________________________________________________________________________
   _________________________________________________________________________

4. **Find your weakest moment of evidence use** — a place where you dropped in a source without enough explanation, or where the connection to your argument is unclear. Copy it here. How would you fix it?

   _________________________________________________________________________
   _________________________________________________________________________

### Sophistication (0--1 point)

5. **Did you engage with complexity?** Specifically: Did you address a counterargument or concession? Did you acknowledge that the issue is more complicated than a simple yes/no? Point to the specific sentences where you did this.

   _________________________________________________________________________
   _________________________________________________________________________

6. **Read your essay as if you disagree with it.** What is the strongest objection someone could raise against your argument? Did your essay anticipate and address it, or did it leave that hole open?

   _________________________________________________________________________
   _________________________________________________________________________

## Bridge-Out — Capstone Reflection: Looking Back Across the Ladder

There is no next rung. You have reached the top.

Take a few minutes to look back at where you started and think honestly about what you have built. The skills you practiced across this ladder — source analysis, rhetorical awareness, evidence-based argumentation, independent reasoning, and now synthesis — are not just AP exam skills. They are the skills of a thinker who can engage with complex problems, weigh competing evidence, and articulate a position that holds up under scrutiny.

### Reflective Prompts

Write a genuine, thoughtful response to each of these. There are no right answers — only honest ones.

**1. The Growth Question**
Look back at Rung 1, where you first learned to analyze sources and evaluate evidence. What can you do now that you could not do then? Be specific — name the skill, describe the difference, and point to a moment in today's work where you used it.

_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

**2. The Difficulty Question**
Which skill across the entire ladder was hardest for you to build? Why? Is it something you now feel confident in, or is it still an area where you need more practice?

_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

**3. The Turning Point Question**
Was there a specific rung, activity, or moment that felt like a breakthrough — where something clicked and your writing or thinking shifted? Describe that moment.

_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________
_____________________________________________________________________________

**4. The Synthesis Question**
In a synthesis essay, you have to hold multiple perspectives in your head at once and build something new from them. Where *outside* of English class might this skill matter? Think about the kinds of decisions, debates, and problems you will face in college, in work, and in life.

_____________________________________________________________________________

*You started this ladder by learning to read one source carefully. You are finishing it by weaving multiple perspectives into a cohesive, sophisticated argument of your own. That is real intellectual growth. Take it with you.*
