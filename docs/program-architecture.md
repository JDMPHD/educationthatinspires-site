# ETI Program Architecture (Current)

## Core Pathway
1. Foundations: Grades 7-8 (can begin in late middle school)
2. The Creative World: Grades 9-10 (preparatory deep humanities and literary arts)
3. Holistic AP Capstone: Grades 11-12 (integrated AP sequence)

## AP Capstone Structure
- Year 11:
  - AP Seminar
  - AP World History
  - AP English
- Year 12:
  - AP Research
  - AP Psychology
  - AP Literature

## Design Implications For Site
- Present pathway as one coherent developmental arc, not separate services.
- Keep Creative World visible and inspiring, but clearly positioned as preparatory for AP work.
- Use simple visuals for grade transitions and yearly AP structure.
- Keep copy concise and gestural on homepage; place detailed pedagogy on dedicated pages.

## AI Literacy Positioning
- AI literacy is a cross-program thread, not a separate module.
- Emphasize human-first collaboration:
  - question quality
  - source verification
  - interpretive judgment
  - protection of voice and originality

## Pending Inputs
- Ongoing curation choices for which Teleodynamic History modules are fully public versus consultation-only.

## Official AP Wording (Approved)
- "Education That Inspires is a fully approved, accredited AP Capstone program through the U.S. College Board."
